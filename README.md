# multi_sensor_slam_ws
Multi-Sensor SLAM System for ROS2 - Integrating LiDAR, Camera, IMU, and GPS

## Overview
This workspace contains a ROS2-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) system that fuses data from multiple sensors to create accurate maps and localization.

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed
- **ROS2 Workspace Setup**: Initialized workspace structure for ROS2 Humble
- **Core Package Structure**: Created three main packages:
  - `multi_sensor_slam_core`: Main SLAM implementation with TF2 and navigation support
  - `multi_sensor_slam_lidar`: LiDAR data processing node
  - `multi_sensor_slam_camera`: Camera/image processing with OpenCV bridge
- **Build System**: All packages build successfully with colcon
- **Dependencies**: Configured with essential ROS2 packages (sensor_msgs, geometry_msgs, nav_msgs, tf2, etc.)

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- **Sensor Calibration**: Investigating koide3's direct_visual_lidar_calibration
  - Currently facing dependency version conflicts (Eigen/GTSAM compatibility)
  - Package temporarily excluded from build until resolved

## Planned Features

### Short Term
1. **Sensor Calibration Pipeline**
   - Integrate direct_visual_lidar_calibration once build issues are resolved
   - Implement automatic extrinsic calibration between sensors
   
2. **Sensor Drivers**
   - LiDAR driver integration (Velodyne/Ouster/Livox support)
   - Camera driver setup with proper intrinsic calibration
   - IMU and GPS driver configuration

3. **Basic SLAM Implementation**
   - Point cloud preprocessing and filtering
   - Feature extraction from LiDAR and camera data
   - Initial odometry estimation

### Medium Term
1. **Sensor Fusion**
   - Tightly-coupled LiDAR-Visual-Inertial odometry
   - GPS integration for global localization
   - Multi-sensor data synchronization

2. **Mapping**
   - 3D point cloud map generation
   - Occupancy grid mapping for navigation
   - Loop closure detection and optimization

3. **Visualization**
   - RViz2 configuration for real-time visualization
   - Web-based monitoring interface

### Long Term
1. **Advanced Features**
   - Dynamic object detection and removal
   - Semantic mapping capabilities
   - Multi-robot SLAM support

2. **Optimization**
   - GPU acceleration for point cloud processing
   - Real-time performance optimization
   - Memory-efficient map management

3. **Applications**
   - Autonomous navigation integration
   - AR/VR applications with accurate localization
   - Integration with popular robotics frameworks
